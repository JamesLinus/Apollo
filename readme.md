Requirements:
=================================================
This is a kernel project for x86 Hardware. Current compilation needs:
	o GNU Make (Or Compatible)
	o NASM, The Netwide Assembler
	o GCC targeted for i586-elf

The kernel is written in X86-Assembly and ANSI-C. We are currently working on
making it as portable as possible.

This software is licensed under the MIT License.
(see License)

Notable Features to Consider:
=================================================
This kernel is in development, and is therefore subject to major changes. The
API is in a state of flux. If developing applications, stick to functions from
the standard c library. All others may be depreceated / removed without notice.

History:
=================================================
This kernel descends from several failed kernel projects; 
o ScorchOS; by Bob Moss and Nicholas Sargente. Circa 2010
o Mercury/SaturnOS; by Brandon Cornell and Nicholas Sargente. Circa 2012
o Apollo Kernel Project; Circa 2009-2011. Nicholas Sargente.

This kernel takes base code from Bkerndev and James Molloy's Tutorials:
