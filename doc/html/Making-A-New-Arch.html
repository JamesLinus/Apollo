<h1 id="apollo-architectures-creating-a-new-one">Apollo Architectures : Creating a New one</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>So You've decided to create a new archetecture support for the Apollo kernel?<br />
There is a few tasks to complete on your platform before Apollo will happily<br />
run on top of it.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In order for Apollo to work happily on your platform, it needs to have a few<br />
items availible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your platform has to be a 32 or 64 bit system. Apollo won't support 16 bit<br />
without massive core arch change.</li>
<li>A Console device of some kind for boot messages, be it serial, a screen<br />
buffer, or even a line printer.</li>
<li>Interrput capability. Without this, the system can't do syscalls from<br />
usermode.</li>
<li>A timer. The kernel uses this for scheduling, and timekeeping. High<br />
precision isn't needed, just at least 10KHz.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="boot-time">Boot time</h2>
<p>The Apollo kernel is a multiboot compliant kernel. The linker script tells<br />
multiboot to look for a symbol called 'start'.</p>
<p>The multiboot bootloader will be looking for a multiboot header, it's the<br />
job of the boot.s file (or equivilent) to provide that. The flags used in the<br />
Kernel should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>MULTIBOOT_MEMORY_INFO</li>
<li>MULTIBOOT_PAGE_ALIGN</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more about the multiboot header from the multiboot specification.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to write a function called start</p>
<p>In your start function you should set up a stack, preferably at least 4k large.<br />
It is also start's task to pass the multiboot header to main, stop interrupts,<br />
and call main.</p>
<p>The stack should be aligned to a 32 byte boundary, in accordance to the SYSV<br />
ABI.</p>
<h2 id="drivers-to-implement">Drivers To Implement</h2>
<p>When Apollo boots, it runs archInit() before doing kernel setup. archInit()<br />
should initialize all of the drivers listed below to a known state.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <a href="Making-A-Console-Driver.html">Console Driver</a>. This is a character output<br />
device used to output the status of the kernel during bootup.</p></li>
<li><p>An Interrupt Vector Driver. This driver should expose a function for creating<br />
interrupt functions for syscalls. The actual syscall interface is handled<br />
by the kernel.</p></li>
<li><p>A Timer Driver. This should be a system timer that exposes functions to help<br />
with scheduling such as alarm() and getTicks().</p></li>
<li><p>Memory handler Driver. This driver basically should give the kernel 4k pages<br />
when requested. This is used internally to power malloc().</p></li>
</ul>
